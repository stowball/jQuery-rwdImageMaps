# jQuery RWD Image Maps

### Allows image maps to be used in a responsive design by recalculating the area coordinates to match the actual image size on load and window.resize

---

#### Usage:

* If possible, add [correct, unitless](http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/img.html) `width` and `height` attributes to your image map images. You can override these in CSS to make them responsive.
* Add a link to jQuery in your page, preferably at the bottom just before the closing `</body>`
* After jQuery, either in a `<script>` block or a separate file, call:

```js
$(window).rwdImageMaps();
```

You may also want to wrap it inside a `$(document).ready()` function, like so:

```js
$(document).ready(function(e) {
    $(window).rwdImageMaps();
});
```
